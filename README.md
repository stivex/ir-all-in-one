# Infrared Remote Control All-in-One
Nowadays in our living rooms we have more than one appliance that it has a remote control. I'm sure that more than once you have had more than a nightmare to know wich remote control has each appliance.

In this project I have tried to simplefy this challenge. I control three appliances (TV, HiFi and Audio Decoder) with only one remote control (TV remote control).

## Requirements
### Hardware
  - Arduino UNO
  - Infrared receiver: KY-022
  - Infrared emitter: KY-005
  - Remote control: AA59-00638A (Samsung TV)
  - Remote control: RM-SR10AV (Sony HiFi)
  - Remote control: Digital-Analog Decoder MOCHA JY-M2 QianHuan
  
### Software
  - Arduino IDE 1.8.7 (Debian 8 GNU/Linux)
  - Arduino AVR Boards 1.6.21
  - [IRLib2 Library]
